          <h2>Dry Skin </h2>
          <h5>Here are some best practices to treat your skin if you are dry or dehydrated</h5>

          <p>First things first, there is always mix up between dry skin and dehydrated skin. If your skin is dry, it means you are lacking oil. Dehydrated skin means you are lacking water. Dry skin means that your skin is not producing enough sebum which helps your skin retain its natural moisture. </p>
          <p>Dehydrated skin will usually have symptoms such as dullness and premature signs of aging. You will also notice that your under eyes will look more tired and darker. You can also experience itchiness.</p>
          <p>Dry skin is lacking oils which can cause your skin to appear scaly and flaky. You will also see that your skin is more red and irritated. In worse cases, you can experience psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis.</p>
          <p>The key to helping either issue is to make sure you are <em>hydrated and moisturized</em>!. Some ingredients that help both are ceramides and hyaluronic acid. However, I have what’s called a controversial opinion on hyaluronic acid. This ingredient can hold a 1000 times its weight in moisture BUT hyaluronic acid pulls moisture from the air and if the air is dry then it’s not going to keep you hydrated. Ceramides are used to help strengthen the skins moisture barrier to help prevent moisture loss.</p>
          <p>Ingredients to use for dehydrated skin would be glycerin, aloe and honey. For this skin type I would recommend more so serums because your skin is not lacking oils. For dry skin you can add oils such as nut, seed, argan, hemp, squalene, jojoba and roes hip. For drier skin types I definitely recommend oils but you can definitely add a hydrating serum as well for an extra boost.</p>
          <p>Other tips: Always pick a cleanser that is a creamy or milky. I always recommend using toners for this category of skin because it’s just another step to have hydration. Use chemical exfoliators because it’s more gentle and it causes less irritation. Best masks to use are ones that you leave on overnight. And always, always wear sunscreen with minimum 30 SPF and wear it all year! And yes even in the winter.</p>

          <h2>Oily Skin</h2>
          <h5>How to combat your oily skin</h5>
          <div class="img">

        </div>
          <p>So you have oily skin, well there’s good news and bad news. Good news, you will age slower because your skins natural oils help protect and preserve the skin. The bad news, you can experience acne, clogged pores and shininess.</p>
          <p>Oily skin is caused by hormonal stimulation of the sebaceous glands and it tends to be clustered in certain areas such as the T-Zone, which includes the forehead, nose, inner cheeks and the chin. There are many factors as to how much oil your skin produce such as weather, diet, stress and good old hormonal changes. </p>
          <p>Look for ingredients in your products such as salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, zinc, retinoids, sulfur, glycolic acid and my personal favorite niacinamide. These ingredients are also amazing for acne. Also use formulas as gels and lotions instead of creams. Use cleansers that are foamy or gels. </p>
          <p>Only cleanse twice a day, morning and at night. Any more than that and you will dry out your skin and it will feel tight. Cleaning more than you should can also have the opposite effect where at this point your skin now has become so dehydrated that your skin is producing much more oil than it used to.  </p>
          <p>If you feel like you need a toner don’t use toners that are alcohol based and don’t use ingredients such as apple cider vinegar but rather use toners with witch hazel or glycerin</p>
          <p>Exfoliation is important but make sure to not overdo it, two to three times a week max. Chemical exfoliation is best for oily skin. Retinoids at night can also be super helpful to help with oil production.</p>
          <p><em>Do not skip out on the moisturizer</em>, even if your skin is oily it still needs moisture and it’s best to use an oil free moisturizer. Again, use your SPF 30!!!</p>
          <p>Other things to help: You can use a cooling mist to help calm and soothe. Use a sulfur or charcoal mask once or twice a week to help skin clarity. Also, don’t touch your face!</p>

          <h2>Anti-Aging</h2>
          <h5>Tips for prevention and repairing fine lines and wrinkles</h5>

          <p>The building blocks of your skin are collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid, and <em>once you hit the age of 25 our bodies start to decline</em> the production of these building blocks and cell turnover is less fast as well. With  products though you can help speed the cell turnover for more of a youthful appearance.</p>
          <p>Start with a gentle cleanser and make sure to double cleanse if you are wearing makeup! A good clean skin will also help your other skincare products work more effectively. Toners are not super necessary here if you are using a gentle cleanser</p>
          <p>Exfoliation is super important but only once or twice a week! Since dead skin cells are not being replaced as fast naturally then you need a little boost from an either a physical or chemical exfoliator but remember to be gentle if you are using a physical one. The best exfoliation is using AHAs which are Alpha-hydroxy acids like glycolic or lactic acids. Glycolic is from sugars and lactic is from milk. Lactic acid being more gentle. </p>
      <p>A good technique to apply your products such as serums and moisturizers is to pat and not to rub.</p>
      <p>There are only two serums you would need. One being vitamin c during the day and two being retinol at night.</p>
      <p> Moisturizing is also super important, I will always say to go for a richer texture because aging skin tends to be on the dry side. But if you are in the prevention era and have oily skin then go for an oil free version. And once again use your 30 SPF!! </p>
      <p> For prevention of fine lines and crows feet under the eye look for eye creams richer in texture with retinol.</p>
      <p>Avoid tanning, smoking and bad diets. Also you can sleep with silk pillow sheets instead of cotton because it inflicts less trauma. Always get lots of rest and sleep when you can. </p>
      <p>Don’t be fooled by fancy marketing and words, if a product says it has collagen in it to help with prevent aging, don’t listen. The molecules of collagen are way too large to penetrate the skin. The only way for it to be effective is to get fillers from a medical professional. </p>
