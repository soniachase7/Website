<p style="text-align:center;">Hi! Welcome to my page, my name is Sonia and here I will talk about everything you need to know about skincare. It's not as complicated as you might think. I have 9 years in the beauty industry. Starting in 2012, I went to makeup school and learned the basics of how to properly take care your skin. Ever since then, I fell in love with that world. I worked as a freelance artist for a short time before working for a major company. It's there that I recieved training every single day and was able to try out so many different products. I have also done some extensive research about products, ingridents and formulas to see what works and what doesnt.To see product reviews, you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soniachase_/"> Instagram</a>

<p style="text-align:center;">There are so many different theories and opinions in skincare for what you need in your routine and what is effective and what is not effective. I am going to tell you the basics of skincare to make it simple and easier to understand so you can feel your best.</p>
  <h><b>Dry Skin</B></h>
<p>First things first, there is always mix up between dry skin and dehyrdated skin. If your skin is dry, it means you are lacking oil. Dehydrated skin means you are lacking water. Dry skin means that your skin is not producing enough sebum which helps your skin retain its natural moisture. </p>
