<p style="text-align:center;">Hi! Welcome to my page, my name is Sonia and here I will talk about everything you need to know about skincare.To see product reviews, you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soniachase_/"target="_blank">Instagram</a>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It's not as complicated as you might think. I have 9 years in the beauty industry. Starting in 2012, I went to makeup school and learned the basics of how to properly take care your skin. Ever since then, I fell in love with that world. I worked as a freelance artist for a short time before working for a major company. It's there that I received training every single day and was able to try out so many different products. I have also done some extensive research about products, ingredients and formulas to see what works and what doesn’t.
There are so many different theories and opinions in skincare for what you need in your routine and what is effective and what is not effective. I am going to tell you the basics of skincare to make it simple and easier to understand so you can feel your best.
Some general skin care best practices that EVERYONE needs to know is you must use sun protection everyday! And I mean everyday even if its cloudy and in the dead of winter, it is the most important step! For sun protection, always use at least 30SPF otherwise it will not do anything for you. Another tip, never be a cheapskate when applying, always use at least a shot glass full for your face and neck then if you have enough put some on your hands.  Also everyone needs to exfoliate at least twice a week whether it’s a physical exfoliator or a chemical one. Eye creams are also a good idea, it is the thinnest part of your skin and it needs a different formula to take care of that area. Toners are not always necessary. If you wear makeup, a double cleanse is always necessary. Either a cleansing oil or a balm then going in with a cleanser that suits your skin type
</p>
  <h><b>Dry Skin</B></h>
<p>First things first, there is always mix up between dry skin and dehydrated skin. If your skin is dry, it means you are lacking oil. Dehydrated skin means you are lacking water. Dry skin means that your skin is not producing enough sebum which helps your skin retain its natural moisture.
Dehydrated skin can happen to anyone, including people with an oiler skin type. Dehydrated skin will usually have symptoms such as dullness and can possibly show premature signs of aging which includes surface wrinkles and loss of firmness. You will also notice that your under eyes will look more tired and darker. You can experience itchiness and a general dullness.
Dry skin is lacking oils which can cause your skin to appear scaly and have flakes. You will also see that your skin is more red and irritated. In worse cases, you can experience psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis.
The key to helping either issue is to make sure you are hydrated and moisturized. Some ingredients that help both are ceramides and hyaluronic acid. However, I have what’s called a controversial opinion on hyaluronic acid. This ingredient can hold a 1000 times its weight in moisture BUT hyaluronic acid pulls moisture from the air and if the air is dry outside then it’s not really going to keep you hydrated. Ceramides are used to help strengthen the skins moisture barrier to help prevent moisture loss.
Ingredients to use for dehydrated skin would be glycerin, aloe and honey. For this skin type I would recommend more so serums because your skin is not lacking oils.
For dry skin you can add oils such as nut, seed, argan, hemp, squalene, jojoba and roes hip. For drier skin types I definitely recommend oils but you can definitely add a hydrating serum as well for an extra boost.
Cleansers and Toners: Always pick a cleanser that is a creamy or milky and don’t use a gel type because it will leave your skin dry and tight. I always recommend using toners for this category of skin because it’s just another step to have hydration.
Others tips: For using exfoliators, always go for a chemical one. It’s more gentle then you think, it causes less irritation. Eye creams, for this skin type go for a heavier consistency, your skin will soak it in faster because that’s what your skin wants.
Lastly this is what your routine should like for dry/dehydrated skin. Think of it as lightest texture to the heaviest.
