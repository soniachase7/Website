          <p>First things first, there is always mix up between dry skin and dehydrated skin. If your skin is dry, it means you are lacking oil. Dehydrated skin means you are lacking water. Dry skin means that your skin is not producing enough sebum which helps your skin retain its natural moisture. </p>
          <p>Dehydrated skin can happen to anyone, including people with an oiler skin type. Dehydrated skin will usually have symptoms such as dullness and premature signs of aging. You will also notice that your under eyes will look more tired and darker. You can experience itchiness.</p>
          <p>Dry skin is lacking oils which can cause your skin to appear scaly and have flakes. You will also see that your skin is more red and irritated. In worse cases, you can experience psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis.</p>
          <p>The key to helping either issue is to make sure you are hydrated and moisturized. Some ingredients that help both are ceramides and hyaluronic acid. However, I have what’s called a controversial opinion on hyaluronic acid. This ingredient can hold a 1000 times its weight in moisture BUT hyaluronic acid pulls moisture from the air and if the air is dry outside then it’s not really going to keep you hydrated. Ceramides are used to help strengthen the skins moisture barrier to help prevent moisture loss.</p>.
          <p>Ingredients to use for dehydrated skin would be glycerin, aloe and honey. For this skin type I would recommend more so serums because your skin is not lacking oils. For dry skin you can add oils such as nut, seed, argan, hemp, squalene, jojoba and roes hip. For drier skin types I definitely recommend oils but you can definitely add a hydrating serum as well for an extra boost.</p>
          <p>Cleansers and Toners: Always pick a cleanser that is a creamy or milky and don’t use a gel type because it will leave your skin dry and tight. I always recommend using toners for this category of skin because it’s just another step to have hydration.</p>
<p>Others tips: For using exfoliators, always go for a chemical one. It’s more gentle then you think, it causes less irritation.</p>
<p>Lastly this is what your routine should like for dry/dehydrated skin. Think of it as lightest texture to the heaviest:</p>
