<p>Hi! Welcome to my page, my name is Sonia and here I will talk about everything you need to know about skincare.To see product reviews, you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soniachase_/"target="_blank">Instagram</a>
</p>
<p>It's not as complicated as you might think. I have 9 years in the beauty industry. Starting in 2012, I went to makeup school and learned the basics of how to properly take care your skin. Ever since then, I fell in love with that world.

<p>First things first, there is always mix up between dry skin and dehydrated skin. If your skin is dry, it means you are lacking oil. Dehydrated skin means you are lacking water. Dry skin means that your skin is not producing enough sebum which helps your skin retain its natural moisture.
